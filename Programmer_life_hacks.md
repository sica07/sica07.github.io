# Life hacks for programmers

## Learn from your bugs
In his book Antifragile, Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes:
“Errors are rich in information”.
Every time I fix a particularly tricky or interesting bug,
I take a few minutes to write down some facts about it.

Suggested entry template:
```
  Date:

  Symptom:

  Cause:

  How found:

  Fix:

  Fixed in file(s):

  Caused by me:

  Time taken to resolve bug:

  Lessons:
  Coding. How can I adjust my coding to avoid these problems in the future?
  Testing. What test case was missing?
  Debugging. How could I have sped up finding this bug? Did I assume too much? Do I need better logging in the code?
```
##### Keypoints:
- not a bug tracker. But especially when hunting down a difficult
  bug over many days, add an entry even if you didn’t cause it.
- write the entry immediately after it has been fixed. That’s when
  all the details are still fresh in my mind.
